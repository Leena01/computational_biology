Individual course in computational biology

In this course, my main goal is to compare multiple methods for creating phylogenetic trees with respect to speed, simplicity and accuracy.
The main methods to be compared are distance-based methods (neighbour joining, UPGMA, WPGMA), maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood.

I intend to work with aligned DNA sequences collected form multiple taxa and use different metrics (e.g., Robinson-Foulds) 
to compare the similarity of the resulting trees.

Since this is an ongoing project, the code base is finished as of now.
