Individual course in computational biology

In this course, my main goal is to compare multiple methods for creating phylogenetic trees with respect to speed, simplicity and accuracy. The main methods to be compared are distance-based methods (neighbour joining, UPGMA, WPGMA), maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. I first present my own implementation of these algorithms and then proceed to analyze the results. Biopython was used for some components and subtasks, e.g., handling the sequence alignments and plotting the trees.

I intend to work with aligned DNA sequences collected form multiple taxa and use different metrics (e.g., Robinson-Foulds) to compare the similarity of the resulting trees. Some aspects may be compared to the performance of Biopython's own implementation.

Since this is an ongoing project, the code base is unfinished as of now.
